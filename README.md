Script 1: CLI APP

**Scripts Made Simple**

**Overview**

This Python script provides a simple, interactive menu-driven tool for managing and executing scripts from designated folders. It includes features for logging, script execution, and menu-based navigation, designed for streamlined usage and error handling.

**Features**

Interactive Menu: Navigate through folders and scripts using a user-friendly menu interface.
* Script Execution: Run individual scripts, multiple scripts, or all scripts within selected folders.
* Logging: Logs all script executions and errors to separate log files for tracking and debugging.
* Reloading: Refresh the list of scripts dynamically.
* Log Viewing: View recent execution logs directly within the application.

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3.12 or later: The script is configured to use Python 3.12's pythonw.exe.
* tqdm: For progress bars.
* Scripts Directory: Ensure your scripts are located in designated folders specified in the script.

**Installation**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using:

          pip install tqdm

3. Place your Python scripts in the designated folders defined in the folders dictionary.

**Configuration**

The script uses the following configuration:

1. Folders: Modify the folders dictionary in the main() function to include paths to your script directories:

    folders = {
    "Accounts": r"c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Py scripts\WORKER\Accounts",
    "ActiveDir": r"c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Py scripts\WORKER\ActiveDir",
      }

2. Log Paths: Update the paths for log files if needed:

 script_log_path = r"C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Py scripts\MASTER\logs\script_log.txt"
info_log_path = r"C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Py scripts\MASTER\logs\info_log.txt"
size_log_path = r"C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Py scripts\MASTER\logs\size_log.txt"

3. Python Executable: The script uses pythonw.exe to run scripts without a console. Update the path if your Python installation is different:

        ["C:\\Path\\To\\Python\\pythonw.exe", script_path]

**Usage**
1. Run the script:
    python script_manager.py

2. Select options from the menu to:
* Navigate to folders.
* Execute scripts.
* View logs.
* Reload scripts.
* Exit the application.

**Menu Options**
* List of Folders: Navigate to scripts in the respective folders.
* Run All Scripts: Execute all scripts across all folders.
* Reload Scripts: Refresh the script list dynamically.
* View Recent Logs: Display logs directly in the console.
* Exit: Quit the program.

**Logging**

The script maintains logs in three files:
* script_log.txt: Tracks script executions.
* info_log.txt: Provides detailed logs, including errors.
* size_log.txt: Reserved for special script logs (e.g., PGsize-specific).

**Error Handling**
* Errors during script execution are logged with timestamps and formatted for readability.
* Logs are flushed immediately to ensure up-to-date information.

**Disclaimer**
Use this tool responsibly. Ensure that the scripts you execute are safe and free from malicious code. Always review and test scripts before running them in production environments.

Script 2: PostgreSQL to CSV Exporter

```markdown
# PostgreSQL to CSV Exporter

A Python script to export data from a PostgreSQL table into a CSV file. The script connects to a PostgreSQL database, executes a query to retrieve data, and writes the results into a specified CSV file.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Export**: Exports data from a PostgreSQL table to a CSV file.
- **Custom Queries**: Easily modify the SQL query to export specific data.
- **Automatic CSV Headers**: Includes table column names as CSV headers.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `psycopg2`
- Access to a PostgreSQL database.

---

## üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/postgres-to-csv-exporter.git
   cd postgres-to-csv-exporter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2
   ```

3. Update the script with your PostgreSQL connection details and query.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Database Connection

Edit the following details in the script:

```python
# PostgreSQL connection details
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="Cylerian",
    user="dave",
    password="!1950!DpD!",
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port="5432"
)
```

### SQL Query

Modify the SQL query to select data from your desired table:

```python
# Execute SQL query to select data
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM Highgate-Vulnerabilities")
```

### CSV File Path

Set the path for the output CSV file:

```python
# Write rows to CSV file
with open('C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\Py scripts\\highgate_vulnerabilities.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    ...
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python postgres_to_csv.py
   ```
2. The script will:
   - Connect to the PostgreSQL database.
   - Execute the specified SQL query.
   - Write the query results into a CSV file.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ highgate_vulnerabilities.csv
```

---

## üìä Output

- **CSV Export**:
  - The specified PostgreSQL table is exported to a CSV file.
- **File Location**:
  - The CSV file is saved to the specified path, e.g.:
    ```plaintext
    C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Py scripts\highgate_vulnerabilities.csv
    ```

---

## üîî Notes

- Ensure the table name and SQL query are valid for your PostgreSQL database.
- Verify file paths and permissions to avoid issues during CSV creation.
